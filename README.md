# Rogue Game

A Rogue game with a character-based UI, built using only Java and very complex OOP with multiple classes and structured documentation using Javadoc and class diagrams. The game features worlds where a player can move between dinosaurs that adhere to specific game physics and rules. Each dinosaur has unique characteristics, including diet, lifespan, starvation periods, and hydration needs, interacting with their environments, including bushes and trees. Players can carry items and interact with dinosaurs for natural balance control, fun, or emotional reasons.
